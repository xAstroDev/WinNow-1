# Useful Tips

- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the preset for Box86/Box64 in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing Wine Mono found in Start Menu -> System Tools.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003 in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- If you want to hide the annoying dxvk hud, please removing this env from here

# System requirements
- `Turnip` - For `Adreno 6xx and 7xx` only at the moment. `Adreno 735, 732, 720, 710 and 613` are not working. You have to use VirGL if you're using this GPU
- `VirGL` - Universal, all GPU `like Mali, Exynos, Kirin, Unisoc, etc`(include unsupport GPU of turnip adreno like in above)` might work with VirGL but you can only play DX9 games
- `LLVMPIPE` - Use this if you want to run software apps `(not for game)`
